# Code

## 1. Load Packages

```{r}

library(Lahman)
library(nlme)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(rio)
library(mdsr)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggridges)

##All but nlme has been cited in the .bib document. If any more packages get used will need to add citation. -Suzie
```

## 2. Read Data

```{r}
data <- import(here("data", "finalproj.csv")) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

## 3. Data Cleaning

### a. Demographics/Characteristics

```{r}

data$gender <- as.factor(data$gender)
data$gender

data$age <- as.factor(data$age)
data$age

data <- data%>%
  mutate(id= row_number())

data <- data %>%
  mutate(yrs_combine = recode(
    yrs_teach,
    "0-1 years" = "0-5 years",
    "2-5 years" = "0-5 years",
    "6-10 years" = "6-10 years",
    "11-15 years" = "11+ years",
    "More than 15 years" = "11+ years",
    .default ="Unknown"  # Change as necessary for unmatched values
  ))

data
```

### b. Measure Cleaning

#### i. Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)

Research Questions (as reference)

1.  Do teacher reports of mental health efficacy differ by school level (i.e., elementary, middle, high school)?Â 

2.  Is there a relationship between teacher years of experience and teacher reports of mental health efficacy?

3.  Is there a relationship between teacher mental health efficacy and burnout?
